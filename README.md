Titanic Survival Classifier ðŸš¢

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using different machine learning classifiers.
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of results across various algorithms.

Project Overview
	â€¢	Dataset: Titanic survival dataset (tested.csv)
	â€¢	Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived or not.
	â€¢	Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation.

Features
	â€¢	Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
	â€¢	Exploratory Data Analysis (feature correlation heatmap)
	â€¢	Model Training:
	  â€¢	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	  â€¢	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	  â€¢	Logistic Regression
	  â€¢	Decision Tree
	  â€¢	Naive Bayes
  â€¢ Performance metrics:
	  â€¢	Accuracy
	  â€¢	Precision
	  â€¢	Recall
	  â€¢	F1 Score
	  â€¢	Visualization of results (heatmaps, bar charts)

Technologies Used
	â€¢	Python
	â€¢	Pandas
	â€¢	NumPy
	â€¢	Scikit-Learn
	â€¢	Matplotlib
	â€¢	Seaborn

 Results
	â€¢	Models were compared based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
	â€¢	KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes performances are visualized for easy comparison.
